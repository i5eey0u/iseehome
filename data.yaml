      we encrypt all conversations (using "end-to-end encryption")

  - name: minimalist
    desc: >
      we intentionally removed all technologies that, under disguis of convenience,
      only make us more disconnected: group chats, avatars, voice notes, photos, videos, etc.
      all that's left are text one-to-one chats. if your friend saw something funny today,
      they won't just send a photo: they will tell you about it using their
      **authentic texting**.
